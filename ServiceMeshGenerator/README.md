# Service Mesh Generator

The ServiceMeshGenerator (`RunServiceMeshGen.py`) generates a .json file that describes the service mesh of the Microservice Application.

### Service Mesh Topology
Literature [studies](https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/13981/EVOKE_CASCON_2020_paper_37_WeakestLink.pdf?sequence=11&isAllowed=y) show that the building of a realistic mesh can be done by using the Barab√°si-Albert (BA) algorithm, which uses a power-law distribution and results in a topology that follows a preferential-attachment model. For this reason we chose to model the service mesh as a BA graph.
If we change the values of the BA model, we are able to generate microservice applications with different mesh topologies. 

The BA algorithm builds the mesh topology as follows: at each step a new service is added as a vertex of a directed tree. This new service is connected with an edge to a single *parent* service already present in the topology. The edge direction is from the parent service to the new *child* service, this means that the parent service includes the new service in its external-services.  
The parent service is chosen according to a preferred attachment strategy using a power-law distribution. Specifically, vertex *i* is chosen as a parent with a (non-normalized) probability equal to *P<sub>i</sub> = d<sub>i</sub><sup>&alpha;</sup> + a*, where *d<sub>i* is the number of services that have already chosen the service *i* as a parent, *&alpha;* is the power-law exponent, and *a* is the zero-appeal parameters i.e., the probability of a service being chosen as a parent when no other service has yet chosen it.

### External Service Grouping
To simulate parallel and sequential calls of external-services, the whole set of external-services of a service is organized in a number of `external_service_groups`. Each group contains a different set of external-services and the insertion of external-services in groups is made according to a water-filling algorithm.

### Service execution
When a service request is received, a service executes its internal-service and then the external-services contained in the external-service groups. For each group, a dedicated thread randomly selects `seq_len` external-services from it and invokes (e.g., HTTP call) them sequentially. These threads are executed in parallel, one per group. If the number of external services is less than the configured number of service groups, some service groups do not exist and existing groups contain only a single external-service (water-filling). If the number of external-services in a group is lower than `seq_len`, all external-services in the service group are invoked sequentially. 

### Databases
To simulate the presence of databases in the microservice application, we added to the above topology some *database-services* that only execute their internal service. Other simple services, select one of these databases with a configurable probability.     


### Input Parameters

<img width="270" src="../ServiceMeshGenerator/servicemesh-demo.png">

There are ten services (no databases), `external_service_groups=2` and `seq_len=2`. The services have an ID equal to `s{service-number}` (databases too). Each service is a key in the JSON with an array as value. An element of the array describes a group of external-services. 
In this case, service s0 has five external-services (children) distributed in two groups. The first is composed of services s1, s4, s9; the second, of services s2, s5. Some services are terminal, since they do not call any external service, as in the case of services s5, s6, s7, s8, s9.
The Service Mesh Generator will generate and save to the `OutputPath` directory two files: the `servicemesh.json` and the `servicemesh.png` for an easier visualization of the generated service mesh, like the one shown above.

### Output Understanding
This is an example of the `servicemesh.json` file generated by the Service Mesh Generator. The related mesh is shown in the .png figure

```json
{"s0": [{"seq_len": 2, "services": ["s1", "s4", "s9"]},
        {"seq_len": 2, "services": ["s2", "s5"]}],
 "s1": [{"seq_len": 2, "services": ["s3"]}, {"seq_len": 2, "services": ["s6"]}],
 "s2": [],
 "s3": [{"seq_len": 2, "services": ["s7"]}],
 "s4": [{"seq_len": 2, "services": ["s8"]}],
 "s5": [],
 "s6": [],
 "s7": [],
 "s8": [],
 "s9": []}
```

# Service Mesh Generator

If you want to learn theoretical insights of the *Service Mesh Generator* [go here](/Docs/BuildingTools.md#Service-Mesh-Generator), otherwise, if you want to run it, go through the following steps.


---
## Install requirements
First, install the requirements using ``pip3``:

```zsh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---
## Run the script
Edit the `ServiceMeshParameters.json` file before running the `ServiceMeshGenerator`.

Finally, run the script to obtain `servicemesh.json` and `servicemesh.png` as follows:

```zsh
python3 RunServiceMeshGen.py
```

## Examples
We illustrate four examples of different service mesh topologies:

##### An highly-centralized hierarchical architectures with most of the services linked to one service (excluded the db services):

```json
{
   "ServiceMeshParameters":{
      "external_service_groups":1,
      "seq_len":1,
      "vertices":10,
      "power":0.05,
      "zero_appeal":0.01,
      "dbs":{
         "nodb":0.2,
         "sdb1":0.6,
         "sdb2":0.4
      }
   },
   "OutputPath": "../SimulationWorkspace"
}
```

##### An applications that rely on a common logging service


```json
{
   "ServiceMeshParameters":{
      "external_service_groups":1,
      "seq_len":1,
      "vertices":10,
      "power":0.9,
      "zero_appeal":0.01,
      "dbs":{
         "nodb":0.2,
         "sdb1":0.6,
         "sdb2":0.4
      }
   },
   "OutputPath": "../SimulationWorkspace"
}
```

##### An application with several auxiliary services:


```json
{
   "ServiceMeshParameters":{
      "external_service_groups":1,
      "seq_len":1,
      "vertices":10,
      "power":0.05,
      "zero_appeal":3.25,
      "dbs":{
         "nodb":0.2,
         "sdb1":0.6,
         "sdb2":0.4
      }
   },
   "OutputPath": "../SimulationWorkspace"
}
```

<img width="400" src="../Docs/service_mesh_example_3.png">

##### An application organized in the conventional multi-tier fashion:

```json
{
   "ServiceMeshParameters":{
      "external_service_groups":1,
      "seq_len":1,
      "vertices":10,
      "power":0.9,
      "zero_appeal":3.25,
      "dbs":{
         "nodb":0.2,
         "sdb1":0.6,
         "sdb2":0.4
      }
   },
   "OutputPath": "../SimulationWorkspace"
}
```
