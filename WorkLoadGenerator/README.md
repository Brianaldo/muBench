The WorkLoadGenerator maps the simulation time steps (in ms) with the services, or rather, with the probability a certain service may execute its job.

```json
[
  {"time": 100, "service": "s0"},
  {"time": 200, "service": "s0"},
  {"time": 500, "service": "s0"},
  {"time": 700, "service": "s0"},
  {"time": 900, "service": "s0"},
  {"time": 1000, "service": "s0"}
]
```
