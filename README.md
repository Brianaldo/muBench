# **µBench** - A high customizable Microservice simulator

**µBench** is a high customizable benchmark tool of microservice applications.
The project aims at facilitating the process of modeling, deploying and monitoring, to reproduce the behavior of complex microservice applications. 

You can shape the mesh topology of interconnected services that describes a microservice application.
You can define the behaviors of the application thanks to the ability of implementing your own stress functions which gives you total control on the aspect to stress, e.g. the CPU, memory, I/O, network, etc.

To emulate real case scenarios, **µBench** deploys the modeled applications on top of distributed environments, like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).
